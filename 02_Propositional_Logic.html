<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The following puzzle, titled "Malice and Alice" is from George
J. Summers, <i>Logical Deduction Puzzles</i>.
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
Alice, Alice's husband, their son, their daughter, and Alice's brother
were involved in a murder. One of the five killed one of the other
four. The following facts refer to the five people mentioned:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A man and a woman were together in a bar at the time of the murder.</li>
<li>The victim and the killer were together on a beach at the time of
the murder.</li>
<li>One of Alice's children was alone at the time of the murder.</li>
<li>Alice and her husband were not together at the time of the murder.</li>
<li>The victim's twin was not the killer.</li>
<li>The killer was younger than the victim.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Which one of the five was the victim?
</p>
<hr  />

<p>
Take the time to try to work out a solution. Summers' book offers the
following hint: "First find the locations of two pairs of people at
the time of the murder, and then determine who the killer and the
victim were so that no condition is contradicted."
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline2"><span class="section-number-3"> 2.2</span> A Solution</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
If you have worked on the puzzle, you may have noticed a few
things. First, it is helpful to draw a diagram, and be systematic
about searching for an answer. The number of characters, locations,
and attributes (murderer, victim) is finite, so that there are only
finitely many possible "states of affairs" that need to be
considered. The numbers are also small enough so that systematic
search through all the possibilities, though tedious, will eventually
get you to the right answer.
</p>

<p>
Another thing that you may have noticed is that the question seems to
presuppose that there is a unique answer to the question, which is to
say, of all the states of affairs that meet the list of conditions,
there is only one person who can possibly be the killer. <i>A priori</i>,
without that assumption, there is a difference between finding <i>some</i>
person who could have been the victim, and show that that person <i>had</i>
to be the victim. Thus, there is a difference between exhibiting some
state of affairs that meets the criteria, and proving that one of the
characters <i>had</i> to be the victim, which is to say, demonstrating
conclusively that no other solution is possible.
</p>

<p>
The published solution in the book not only produces a state of
affairs that meets the criterion, but at the same time proves that
this is the only one that does so. It is quoted below, in full.
</p>

<hr  />
<p>
From <code>[1]</code>, <code>[2]</code>, and <code>[3]</code>, the roles of the five people were as
follows: Man and Woman in the bar, Killer and Victim on the beach, and
Child alone.
</p>

<p>
Then, from <code>[4]</code>, either Alice's husband was in the bar and Alice was
on the beach, or Alice was in the bar and Alice's husband was on the
beach.
</p>

<p>
If Alice's husband was in the bar, the woman he was with was his
daughter, the child who was alone was his son, and Alice and her
brother were on the beach. Then either Alice or her brother was the
victim; so the other was the killer. But, from <code>[5]</code>, the victim had a
twin, and this twin was innocent. Since Alice and her brother could
only be twins to each other, this situation is impossible. Therefore
Alice's husband was not in the bar.
</p>

<p>
So Alice was in the bar. If Alice was in the bar, she was with her
brother or her son.
</p>

<p>
If Alice was with her brother, her husband was on the beach with one
of the two children. From <code>[5]</code>, the victim could not be her husband,
because none of the others could be his twin; so the killer was her
husband and the victim was the child he was with. But this situation
is impossible, because it contradicts <code>[6]</code>. Therefore, Alice was not
with her brother in the bar. 
</p>

<p>
So Alice was with her son in the bar. Then the child who was alone was
her daughter. Therefore, Alice's husband was with Alice's brother on
the beach. From previous reasoning, the victim could not be Alice's
husband. But the victim could be Alice's brother because Alice could
be his twin. 
</p>

<p>
So <i>Alice's brother was the victim</i> and Alice's husband was the
killer.
</p>
<hr  />

<p>
This argument relies on some "extra logical" elements, for example,
that a father cannot be younger than his child, and that a parent and
his or her child cannot be twins. But there are also a number of
common logical terms, and associated patterns of inference. In the
next section, we will focus on some of the rules governing the terms
"and," "or," "not," and "if &#x2026; then". Following the model described
in the introduction, each such construction will be analyzed on three
levels:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the way it is used and employed in informal (mathematical) arguments</li>
<li>a formal, symbolic representation</li>
<li>the implementation in <i>Lean</i></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="orgheadline3"><span class="section-number-4"> 2.3.1</span> Implication</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-1">
<p>
The first pattern of reasoning we will discuss, involving "if
&#x2026; then," may be the most confusing, because its use is largely
implicit in the solution above. Consider the fourth paragraph. Spelled
out in greater detail, the inference runs as follows:
</p>

<hr  />
<p>
If Alice was in the bar, Alice was with her brother or son.
</p>

<p>
Alice was in the bar.
</p>

<p>
Alice was with her brother or son.
</p>
<hr  />

<p>
This rule is sometimes known as <i>modus ponens</i>, or "implication
elimination," since it tells us how to use an implication in an
argument. In a system of natural deduction, it is expressed as
follows:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_46e555e7ba4fd0b0cb485c3438348fc25fca3f7d.png" alt="\begin{center}
\AXM{A \to B}
\AXM{A}
\RL{$\mathord{\to}\mathrm{E}$}
\BIM{B}
\DP
\end{center}
" /></p>
</div>
<p>
The way to read this is as follows: if you have a proof of <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_de9a2541df57adb5d4ef809a251381d580bbf931.png" alt="$A \to
B$" />, possibly from some hypotheses, and a proof of <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" />, possibly
from hypotheses, then combining these yields a proof of <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_d97dc406cb5606cb9d7e849c11adc553d50b79a6.png" alt="$B$" />, from the
hypotheses in both subproofs.
</p>

<p>
In Lean, the inference is expressed as follow:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-1' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">variables (A B : Prop)
premises (H₁ : A → B) (H₂ : A)

example : B := 
show B, from H₁ H₂
</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-1' style='display:none'>variables (A B : Prop)
premises (H₁ : A → B) (H₂ : A)

example : B := 
show B, from H₁ H₂
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-1').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
The first command declares two variables, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, ranging over
propositions. The second line introduces two premises, namely, <code>A → B</code>
and <code>A</code>. The next line asserts, as an example, that <code>B</code> follows from
the premises. The proof is written simply <code>H₁ H₂</code>: think of this as
the premise <code>H₁</code> "applied to" the premise <code>H₂</code>. 
</p>

<p>
You can enter the arrow by writing <code>\to</code> or <code>\imp</code> or <code>\r</code>. You can
enter <code>H₁</code> by typing <code>H\_1</code>. It is conventional to use the letter <code>H</code>
for a hypothesis, but you can use any reasonable alphanumeric
identifier. The name <code>H1</code> is a different from <code>H₁</code>, but also a
reasonable choice.
</p>

<p>
The rule for proving an "if &#x2026; then" statement is more
subtle. Consider the beginning of the third paragraph, which argues
that if Alice's husband was in the bar, then Alice or her brother
was the victim. Abstracting away some of the details, the argument has
the following form:
</p>

<hr  />
<p>
Suppose Alice's husband was in the bar.
</p>

<p>
Then &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Then &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Then Alice or her brother was the victim.
</p>

<p>
Thus, if Alice's husband was in the bar, then Alice or her brother was the victim.
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
This is a form of <i>hypothetical reasoning</i>. On the supposition that
<img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" /> holds, we argue that <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_d97dc406cb5606cb9d7e849c11adc553d50b79a6.png" alt="$B$" /> holds as well. If we have successful, we
have shown that <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" /> implies <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_d97dc406cb5606cb9d7e849c11adc553d50b79a6.png" alt="$B$" />, without supposing <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" />. In other
words, the temporary assumption that <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" /> holds is "canceled" by
making it explicit in the conclusion.
</p>

<div class="figure">

<p>
The hypothesis is given the label <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_5036dd76902b97a998bc024eb115e3b1e701dbb8.png" alt="$H$" />; when the introduction rule is
applied, the label <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_5036dd76902b97a998bc024eb115e3b1e701dbb8.png" alt="$H$" /> indicates the relevant hypothesis. The line
over the hypothesis indicates that the assumption has been "canceled"
by the introduction rule.
</p>

<p>
In Lean, this inference takes the following form:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-2' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">variables (A B : Prop)

example : A → B :=
assume H : A,
show B, from sorry
</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-2' style='display:none'>variables (A B : Prop)

example : A → B :=
assume H : A,
show B, from sorry
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-2').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
To prove <code>A → B</code>, we assume <code>A</code>, with label <code>H</code>, and show <code>B</code>. Here,
the word <code>sorry</code> indicates that the proof is omitted. In this case,
this is necessary; since <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are arbitrary propositions, there
is no way to prove <code>B</code> from <code>A</code>. In general, though, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> will
be compound expressions, and you are free to use the hypothesis <code>H :
A</code> to prove <code>B</code>.
</p>

<p>
Using <code>sorry</code>, we can illustrate the implication elimination rule
alternatively as follows:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-3' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">variables (A B : Prop)

example : B :=
have H₁ : A → B, from sorry,
have H₂ : A, from sorry,
show B, from H₁ H₂
</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-3' style='display:none'>variables (A B : Prop)

example : B :=
have H₁ : A → B, from sorry,
have H₂ : A, from sorry,
show B, from H₁ H₂
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-3').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline4"><span class="section-number-4"> 2.3.2</span> Conjunction</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-2">
<p>
As was the case for implication, other logical connectives are
generally characterized by their <i>introduction</i> and <i>elimination</i>
rules. The former show how to establish a claim involving the
connective, while the latter show how to use such a claim to derive
others.
</p>

<p>
Let us consider, for example, the case of conjunction, that is, the
word "and." Informally, we establish a conjunction by establishing
each conjunct. For example, informally we might argue:
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
Alice's brother was the victim.
</p>

<p>
Alice's husband was the killer.
</p>

<p>
Therefore Alice's brother was the victim and Alice's husband was the
killer.
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
The inference seems superfluous, since the word "and" simply combines the
two assertions into one, and informal proofs often downplay the
distinction. In natural deduction, the rule reads as follows:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_e9d7aa9ab635288efefe04fab432a2a0c8c41cde.png" alt="\begin{center}

\AXM{B}
\RL{$\mathord{\wedge}\mathrm{I}$}
\BIM{A \wedge B}
\DP
\end{center}
" /></p>
</div>
<p>
In Lean, the rule is denoted <code>and.intro</code>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-4' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">variables (A B : Prop)

example : A ∧ B :=
have H₁ : A, from sorry,
have H₂ : B, from sorry,
show A ∧ B, from and.intro H₁ H₂
</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-4' style='display:none'>variables (A B : Prop)

example : A ∧ B :=

show A ∧ B, from and.intro H₁ H₂
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-4').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
You can enter the wedge symbol by typing <code>\and</code>.
</p>

<p>
The two elimination rules allow us to extract the two components:
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
Alice's husband was in the bar and Alice was on the beach.
</p>

<p>
So Alice's husband was in the bar.
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
Or:
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
Alice's husband was in the bar and Alice was on the beach.
</p>

<p>
So Alice's was on the beach.
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
In natural deduction, these patterns are rendered as follows:
</p>

<div class="figure">

In Lean, the inferences are known as <code>and.left</code> and <code>and.right</code>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-5' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">variables (A B : Prop)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-3">
<p>
In logical terms, showing "not A" amounts to showing that A leads to a
contradiction. For example:
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
Suppose Alice's husband was in the bar. 
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
This situation is impossible. 
</p>

<p>
Therefore Alice's husband was not in the bar.
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
This is another form of hypothetical reasoning, similar to that used
in establishing an "if &#x2026; then" statement: we temporarly assume A,
show that leads to a contradiction, and conclude that "not A"
holds.
</p>

<p>
In natural deduction, the rule reads as follows:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_ff94c0ca008f6e11baef670e87f7e253496279bb.png" alt="\begin{center}

" /></p>
</div>
<p>
In Lean, it is illustrated by the following:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-6' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">variable A : Prop

example : ¬ A :=
assume H : A,

show false, from sorry
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-6').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
You can enter the negation symbol by typing <code>\not</code>.
</p>

<p>
The elimination rule is dual to these. It expresses that if we have
both "A" and "not A," then we have a contradiction. This pattern is
illustrated in the informal argument below, which is implicit in the
fourth paragraph of the solution to "Malice and Alice."
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
So the killer was her husband and the victim was the child he was
with.
</p>

<p>
So the killer was not younger than his victim.
</p>

<p>
But according to <code>[6]</code>, the killer was younger than his victim.
</p>

<p>
This situation is impossible.
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
In symbolic logic, the rule of inference is expressed as follows:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_8b5a7732365a9df58572ccbd050107efc4886936.png" alt="\begin{center}

<p>
And in Lean, it is implemented in the following way:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-7' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">variable A : Prop

example : false :=
have H₁ : ¬ A, from sorry,

</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-7').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
Notice that the negation elimination rule is expressed in a manner
similar to implication elimination: the label asserting the negation
comes first, and by "applying" the proof of the negation to the
proof of the positive fact, we obtain a proof of falsity.
</p>

<p>
Notice that in the symbolic framework, we have introduced a new
symbol, <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_7bea1d03799b42f9b799647895fded7894b866bd.png" alt="$\bot$" />. It corresponds to the identifier <code>false</code> in Lean, and
natural language phrases like "this is a contradiction" or "this is
impossible". 
</p>

<p>
What are the rules governing <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_7bea1d03799b42f9b799647895fded7894b866bd.png" alt="$\bot$" />? In natural deduction, there is no
introduction rule; "false" is false, and there should be no way to
prove it, other than extract it from contradictory hypotheses. On the
other hand, natural deduction provides a rule that allows us to
conclude anything from a contradiction:
</p>

<div class="figure">

<p>
The elimination rule also has the fancy Latin name, <i>ex falso
sequitur quodlibet</i>, which means ``anything you want follows from
falsity.'' In Lean it is implemented as follows:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-8' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">variable A : Prop

example : A :=

</div>
<p>
The false elimination rule is harder to motivate from a natural
language perspective, but, nonetheless, it is really needed to capture
common patterns of inference. One way to understand it is
this. Consider the following statement:
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
For every natural number <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_6456f2649ddade5686905f71bd3d22a9376cf8af.png" alt="$n$" />, if <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_6456f2649ddade5686905f71bd3d22a9376cf8af.png" alt="$n$" /> is prime and greater than 2, then
<img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_6456f2649ddade5686905f71bd3d22a9376cf8af.png" alt="$n$" /> is odd.
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
We would like to say that this is a true statement. But if it is true,
then it is true of any number <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_6456f2649ddade5686905f71bd3d22a9376cf8af.png" alt="$n$" />. Taking <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_e62b3f122ad8b60e27eb1c9a46bee4bb6f8ec5d5.png" alt="$n = 2$" />, we have the
statement:
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
If 2 is prime and greater than 2, then 2 is odd.
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
In this conditional statement, both the antecedent and succedent are
false. The fact that we are committed to saying that this statement is
true shows that we should be able to prove, one way or another, that
the statement 2 is odd follows from the false statement that 2 is
prime and greater than 2. The <i>ex falso</i> neatly encapsulates this sort
of inference.
</p>

<p>
Notice that if we define <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_c9fc0b9f87a04276e5274737b465662205a69233.png" alt="$\neg A$" /> to be <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_9eb1ac6b4f02410feea1ca6215e48d255300a699.png" alt="$A \to \bot$" />, then the rules
for negation introduction and elimination are nothing more than
implication introduction and elimination, respectively. We have think
of <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_c9fc0b9f87a04276e5274737b465662205a69233.png" alt="$\neg A$" /> expressed colorfully by saying "if <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" /> is true, then pigs

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-4">
<p>
The introduction rules for disjunction, otherwise known as "or," are
straightforward. For example, the claim that condition <code>[3]</code> is met in
the proposed solution can be justified as follows:
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
Alice's daughter was alone at the time of the murder.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, either Alice's daughter was alone at the time of the
murder, or Alice's son was alone at the time of the murder.

In terms of natural deduction, the two introduction rules are as
follows:

You can enter the vee symbol by typing <code>\or</code>. The identifiers <code>inl</code>
and <code>inr</code> stand for "insert left" and "insert right," respectively.
</p>

<p>
The disjunction elimination rule is trickier, but it represents a
natural form of case-based hypothetical reasoning. The instances that
occur in the solution to "Malice and Alice" are all special cases of
this rule, so it will be helpful to make up a new example. Suppose, in
the argument above, we had established that either Alice's brother or
her son was in the bar, and we wanted to argue for the conclusion that
her husband was on the beach. One option is to argue by cases: first,
consider the case that her brother was in the bar, and argue for the
conclusion on the basis of that assumption; then consider the case
that her son was in the bar, and argue for the same conclusion, this
time on the basis of the second assumption. Since the two cases are
exhaustive, if we know that the conclusion holds in each case, we know
that it holds outright. The pattern looks something like this:
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
Either Alice's brother was in the bar, or Alice's son was in the bar.
</p>

<p>
Suppose, in the first case, that her brother was in the bar. Then
&#x2026; Therefore, her husband was on the beach.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, suppose her son was in the bar. In that case,
&#x2026; Therefore, in this case also, her husband was on the beach.
</p>

<p>
Either way, we have established that her husband was on the beach.
</p>
<hr  />
<p>
In natural deduction, this pattern is expressed as follows:
</p>

<div class="figure">

<p>
As noted in Chapter <a href="#" onclick="myModule.loadTutorial('01_Introduction.html', 'MissingReference')">Introduction</a>, there are two common styles for
writing natural deduction derivations. (The word "derivation" is often
used to connote a formal proof instead of an informal one. When
talking about natural deduction, we will use the words "derivation"
and "proof" interchangeably.) In both cases, proofs are presented on
paper as trees, with the conclusion at the theorem at the root, and
hypotheses up at the leaves. In the first style of presentation, the
set of hypotheses is written explicitly at every node of the
tree. This is helpful because some rules (namely, implication
introduction, negation introduction, or elimination, and proof by
contradiction) change the set of hypotheses, by canceling a local or
temporary assumption. Nonetheless, we will use a style of presentation
that leaves this information implicit, so that each node of the tree
is labelled with an explicit formula. Some people like to label each
inference with the rule that is used, but that is usually clear from
the context, so we will omit that as well. But when a rule cancels a
hypothesis, we will make that clear in the following way: we will
label all instances of the hypothesis at the leaves with a letter,
like "x," and then we will use that letter to annotate the place where
the rule is canceled.
</p>

<p>
In addition to all the rules listed in the last section, there is one
additional rule that is central to the system, namely the assumption
rule. It works like this: at any point, you can assume a hypothesis,
<img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" />. The way to "read" such a one-line proof is this: assuming <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" />,
you have proved <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" />. Without this rule, there would be no way of
getting a proof of the ground! After all, every rule listed in the
last section has premises, which is to say, it can only be applied to
derivations that have been constructed previously.
</p>

<p>
Let us consider a few examples. In each case, you should think about
what the formulas say and which rule of inference is invoked at each
step. Also pay close attention to which hypotheses are canceled at
each stage. If you look at any node of the tree, what has been
established at that point is that the claim follows from the
uncanceled hypotheses. Here is a proof of <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_2d65acc830c8d46eb73f2e1e35c94aa726174eec.png" alt="$(A \wedge (B \vee C)) \to

<p>
There is a general heuristic that is useful for deriving theorems like
these, namely:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>First, work backwards from the conclusion, using the introduction
rules. For example, if you are trying to prove a statement of the
form <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_3a9090234befeadc30f2545de2a44cc4fe6badf4.png" alt="$A \to B$" />, add <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" /> to your list of hypotheses and try to
derive <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_d97dc406cb5606cb9d7e849c11adc553d50b79a6.png" alt="$B$" />. If you are trying to prove a statement of the form <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_be31c611b4efedbbae42e918c199920ff2338806.png" alt="$A
   \wedge B$" />, use the and-introduction rule to reduce your task to
proving <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" />, and then proving <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_d97dc406cb5606cb9d7e849c11adc553d50b79a6.png" alt="$B$" />.</li>
<li>When you have run out things to do in the first step, use
elimination rules to work forwards. If you have hypotheses <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_7fc9f96fc7f04ae5bca5f99e10971c2a7578aa45.png" alt="$A \to

hypothesis <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_454a2b03e9bbd58443ca50360be2588e72d2d909.png" alt="$A \vee B$" />, use or elimination and try to prove any open
goals by splitting on cases, considering <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" /> in one case and <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_d97dc406cb5606cb9d7e849c11adc553d50b79a6.png" alt="$B$" /> in
the other.</li>
<li>If all else fails, use a proof by contradiction.</li>
</ol>

<p>
When writing expressions in symbolic logic, we will adopt the an order
of operations, which allow us to drop superfluous parentheses. When
parsing an expression:
&#x2013; negation binds most tightly
&#x2013; then conjunctions and disjunctions, from right to left
&#x2013; and finally implications and bi-implications.
So, for example, the expression <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_ace3b80f722e8c2d279d113e8832219bed35dd64.png" alt="$\neg A \vee B \to C \wedge D$" /> is
understood as <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_e22bf21dac5de9df570744886f83a72f05a6b736.png" alt="$((\neg A) \vee B) \to (C \wedge D)$" />
</p>

<p>
The next proof shows that if a conclusion, <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_d5420fe138f4d39b6f52f71250e99e0a36aaaab5.png" alt="$C$" />, follows from <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" /> and
<img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_d97dc406cb5606cb9d7e849c11adc553d50b79a6.png" alt="$B$" />, then it follows from their conjunction.

We will see that Lean has mechanisms for modeling proofs at a higher
level than natural deduction derivations. At the same time, you can
also carry out low-level inferences, and carry out proofs that mirror
natural deduction proofs quite closely. Here is a Lean representation
of the first example in the previous section:

The first line declares propositional variables <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code>. The
line that begins with the keyword <code>example</code> declares the theorem to be
proved, and the notation <code>:=</code> indicates that the proof will
follow. The line breaks and indentation is only for the purposes of
readability; Lean would do just was well if the entire proof were
written as one run-on line.
</p>

<p>
Here are some additional notes:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; It is often important to name a theorem for future proof. Lean
   allows us to do that, using one of the keywords <code>theorem</code>, <code>lemma</code>,
   <code>proposition</code>, <code>corollary</code>, followed by the name of the proof.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; You can omit a label in a <code>have</code> statement. You can then refer to
   that fact using the label <code>this</code>, until the next anonymoyus
   <code>have</code>. Alternatively, at any point later in the proof, you can
   refer to the fact by putting the assertion between backticks.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; One can also omit the label in an <code>assumption</code> by using the keyword
   <code>suppose</code> instead.
</p>

<p>
With these features, the previous proof can be written as follows:

In fact, such a presentation provides Lean with more information than
is really necessary to construct an axiomatic proof. The word <code>assume</code>
can be replaced by the symbol <code>λ</code>, assertions can be omitted from an
<code>assume</code> when they can be inferred from context, the justification of
a have statement can be inserted in places where the label was
otherwise used, and one can omit the <code>show</code> clauses, giving only the
justification. As a result, the previous proof can be written in an
extremely abbreviated form:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

example : A ∧ (B ∨ C) → (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C) :=
λ H₁, or.elim (and.right H₁)
  (λ H₄, or.inl (and.intro (and.left H₁) H₄))

Such proofs tend to be harder to write, read, understand, maintain,
and debug, however, and so we will tend to favor structure and
readability over brevity.

The next proof in the previous section can be rendered in Lean as
follows:

In the examples above, we showed that, given <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_454a2b03e9bbd58443ca50360be2588e72d2d909.png" alt="$A \vee B$" /> and <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_c9fc0b9f87a04276e5274737b465662205a69233.png" alt="$\neg A$" />,
we can derive <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_d97dc406cb5606cb9d7e849c11adc553d50b79a6.png" alt="$B$" /> in natural deduction. This is a common pattern of
inference, and, having justified it once, one might reasonably want to
use it freely as a new one-step inference. Similarly, having proved <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_35693d56cafba26767dfd32f68fdcf7cbdea19cb.png" alt="$A
\to B$" /> equivalent to <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_6581c5cc6ec29087c217297d610fff2f401c9596.png" alt="$\neg A \vee B$" />, or <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_15b57da155bd200da977f355320d65d985c35b6e.png" alt="$\neg (A \vee B)$" /> equivalent

by the other in any expression.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, this is how informal mathematics works: even if we start with
some basic rules of inference, we learn to recognize more complex
patterns and apply them freely. A single step in the informal argument in
the solution to "Malice and Alice," or any mathematical proof, usually
requires many more steps in a formal calculus. Moreover, in ordinary
mathematics, one we prove a proposition or theorem, we can freely
invoke it in another proof later on.
</p>

<p>
In symbolic logic, "derived rules".
</p>

<p>
In Lean, naming theorems and reusing them. (Also, eventually, automation.)
</p>


<p>
To summarize:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; When we ask you to prove something in natural deduction, our goal
   is to make you work with the precise, formal rules of the
   system. So you should not appeal to external rules unless we
   explicitly say so.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; When writing informal proofs, it is a judgment call as to what
   prior patterns of reasoning and background facts you may appeal
   to. In a classroom setting, the goal may be to demonstrate mastery
   of the subject to the instructors, in which case, context should
   dictate what is allowable (and it is always a good idea to err on
   the side of caution). In real life, your goal is to convince your
   target audience, and you will have to rely on convention and
   experience to judge what patterns of inference you can put forth,
   and how much detail you need to use.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; In interactive theorem proving, the main goal is to have the
   computer certify the proof as correct, and in that respect,
   automation and facts from the library are fair game. In this class,
   we will try to be explicit about what we would like you to use in 
   the exercises we assign.

<h3 id="orgheadline15"><span class="section-number-3"> 2.8</span> Truth Tables and Semantics</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-8">
<p>
In the previous sections, we've seen how to prove logical formulas from hypotheses.
If the hypotheses are true, the derived formula must be true as well. A formula
that can be derived from no hypotheses is said to be <i>valid</i>: for example, 
<img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_585c86a387e7ad9adf7775bb8281afb8d761dbd1.png" alt="$A \to A$" /> is true no matter what we suppose about <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" />.
</p>

<p>
Not every sentence is valid, of course. Earlier we saw the example <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_3a9090234befeadc30f2545de2a44cc4fe6badf4.png" alt="$A \to B$" />.
We cannot derive this formula without some extra assumptions about <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" /> and <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_d97dc406cb5606cb9d7e849c11adc553d50b79a6.png" alt="$B$" />.
Try it:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-16' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">variables A B : Prop

example : A → B :=
assume H : A,

show B, from sorry
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-16').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>

<p>
Without some more information, there's no argument we could put in place of the
"sorry" to complete this proof. After all, <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_d97dc406cb5606cb9d7e849c11adc553d50b79a6.png" alt="$B$" /> could be false!
</p>

<p>
What do we mean by "false," exactly? Notice that we've been careful not to use
the words "true" and "false" before now. Deductions and formal proofs are
<i>syntactic</i> ideas- that is, they have to do with the symbols and symbolic
structure of the formulas involved. Truth is a <i>semantic</i> notion- it ascribes
some extra-logical <i>meaning</i> to they symbols involved.
</p>

<p>
Syntactically, we were able to ask and answer questions like the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can I derive a certain formula from certain hypotheses?</li>
<li>How do I derive a certain formula from certain hypotheses?</li>
<li>What formulas can I derive from certain hypotheses?</li>
</ul>

<p>
The questions we consider semantically are slightly different:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Given a truth assignment for propositional variables, is a certain formula
true or false?</li>
<li>Under what conditions is a certain formula true or false?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Our notions of syntax and semantics have developed carefully, so that they exist
in harmony. We'll expand on this in the next section. For now, we'll discuss the
basic methods we use to answer semantic questions.
</p>

<p>
The first notion we'll need is that of a <i>truth value</i>. Conveniently, we know
our two truth values already: they're just "true" and "false." (We'll use the
symbols <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_5e63c8abf3b0c42012365b5702f80124df3a70e4.png" alt="$\top$" /> and <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_7bea1d03799b42f9b799647895fded7894b866bd.png" alt="$\bot$" />, respectively.) (Jeremy, will we? Do you prefer other notation?)
</p>

<p>
In this class, we'll adopt a "classical" notion of truth. This notion comes with
many implications. For now, though, it means only the following: any proposition
is either true or false, but not both. This means a proposition cannot be neither
true nor false.
</p>

<p>
This binary conception of truth corresponds to the syntactic tautology <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_9ede797ed8eed1b96b7d91381cfb9fabfa220c0f.png" alt="$A \vee \not A$" />.
Semantically, we read this sentence as saying "either <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" /> is true, or <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_c26c2d0c36eb5b7b9af2a1766d695439dafba78d.png" alt="$\not A$" /> is
true." Since <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_c26c2d0c36eb5b7b9af2a1766d695439dafba78d.png" alt="$\not A$" /> is true exactly when <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" /> is false, it equivalently says
"either <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" /> is true, or <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" /> is false."
</p>

<p>
The next notion we'll need is that of a <i>truth assignment</i>. A truth assignment
simply tells us which atomic statements are true, and which are false. In formal logic,
this amounts to a mapping from our propositional letters <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_cfd84d0cf5b16a0279ed47d0d5204f0d029e1098.png" alt="$A$" />, <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_d97dc406cb5606cb9d7e849c11adc553d50b79a6.png" alt="$B$" />, etc. to the set
of truth values <img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_f8de1a13623588006fbc9b7d0096a41b75d66af7.png" alt="$\{ \top, \bot \}$" />. For instance,
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_2009ee7264e487321849ae49a6e4a0e3e0b06e1d.png" alt="$A := \top$" /></li>
<li><img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_26142b44b10500381e4803673887237ceab20000.png" alt="$B := \top$" /></li>
<li><img src="ltxpng/02_Propositional_Logic.org.temp_fdb1d7a459ab0fb582e611543e42020b878b2ee2.png" alt="$C := \bot$" /></li>
</ul>
